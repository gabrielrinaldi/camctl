Fan/pump speed control on Mac for NZXT Kraken X62

# DISCLAIMER
Use at your **own risk**, I take **NO** responsibility if anything crazy happens. Neither does NZXT as they are not involved.

With that said however, this is basic stuff - nothing crazy has happened in my testing, and I can't think of a reason why anything bad could happen.
